C programming:

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
	printf("Hello World");
}
-------------------------------
Java Programming:
--> In java every method must be present inside the class as per the rules of java

class Program1 //main class
{
	public static void main( String args[] )
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

public : to make main method visible for the OS
static : to make main method accessible and to execute the main class without object creation
void   : as the main method will not have any return value

lyman terms:
From the System generate an output which must be printed as "hello world"
